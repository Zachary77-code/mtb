       Abstract: The Belgian Precision initiative aims to maximize the implementation of tumor-agnostic next-generation sequencing in patients with advanced cancer and enhance access to molecularly guided treatment options. Academic tumor-agnostic basket phase II studies are part of this initiative. The current investigator-driven trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of olaparib in advanced cancers with a (likely) pathogenic mutation (germline or somatic) in a gene that plays a role in homologous recombination (HR).

       Findings: ATM mutations (15% of mCRC) associated with significantly longer overall survival (64.9 vs 34.8 months).
       Abstract: Tumors bearing homologous recombination deficiency are extremely sensitive to DNA double strand breaks induced by several chemotherapeutic agents. ATM gene, encoding a protein involved in DNA damage response, is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (CRC), but its potential role as predictive and prognostic biomarker has not been fully investigated. We carried out a multicenter effort aimed at defining the prognostic impact of ATM mutational status in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients. Mutational profiles were obtained by means of next-generation sequencing. Overall, 35 out of 227 samples (15%) carried an ATM mutation. At a median follow-up of 56.6 months, patients with ATM mutated tumors showed a significantly longer median overall survival (OS) versus ATM wild-type ones (64.9 vs 34.8 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; P = 0.01). In the multivariable model, ATM mutations confirmed the association with longer OS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.98; P = 0.04). The prognostic impact of ATM mutations was independent from TP53 mutational status and primary tumor location. High heterogeneity score for ATM mutations, possibly reflecting the loss of wild-type allele, was associated with excellent prognosis. In conclusion, we showed that ATM mutations are independently associated with longer OS in patients with mCRC.

       Findings: Review of ATM's role in hereditary CRC; loss of ATM expression correlates with worse survival; potential biomarker.
       Abstract: Colorectal cancer found to be the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide which can be prevented by screening and its curable if diagnosed early. Lynch syndrome/HNPCC being an autosomal genetic disease and propensity in forming colorectal cancer is inherited wherein genomic instabilities and epigenetic changes are being the characteristic forms in hereditary cancers. It is very important to determine the polymorphism in several DNA repairing genes such as ATM, RAD51, XRCC2, XRCC3 and XRCC9 to study the risk exploring both the prognosis and the developing of colorectal cancer. The role of ATM gene has been studied which involves in the hereditary transfer of colorectal cancer associated with other related cancers such as stomach, lung and breast cancers. ATM found to be the mutation target and also a modifier gene with more risk of developing the disease by its polymorphism in variant of ATM D1853N. It was identified that ATM gene polymorphism did not drastically change HNPCC age of onset. ATM expression levels were studied and it has been concluded that the complete loss of ATM expression resulted in a propensity of worse survival and no better prognosis with increase in mortality rate. This ATM gene might be considered to be a predicted biomarker in colorectal cancer.

       Findings: ATM germline mutations significantly enriched in CRC (OR 2.97); biallelic loss of ATM observed in tumors; suggests PARP inhibitor sensitivity.
       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) heritability has been estimated to be around 30%. However, mutations in the known CRC-susceptibility genes explain CRC risk in fewer than 10% of affected individuals. Germline mutations in DNA-repair genes (DRGs) have recently been reported in CRC, but their contribution to CRC risk is largely unknown. We evaluated the gene-level germline mutation enrichment of 40 DRGs in 680 unselected CRC individuals and 27,728 ancestry-matched cancer-free adults. Significant findings were then examined in independent cohorts of 1,661 unselected CRC individuals and 1,456 individuals with early-onset CRC. Of the 680 individuals in the discovery set, 31 (4.56%) individuals harbored germline pathogenic mutations in known CRC-susceptibility genes, and another 33 (4.85%) individuals had DRG mutations that have not been previously associated with CRC risk. Germline pathogenic mutations in ATM and PALB2 were enriched in both the discovery (OR = 2.81 and p = 0.035 for ATM and OR = 4.91 and p = 0.024 for PALB2) and validation (OR = 2.97 and adjusted p = 0.0013 for ATM and OR = 3.42 and adjusted p = 0.034 for PALB2) sets. Biallelic loss of ATM was evident in all individuals with matched tumor profiling. CRC individuals also had higher rates of actionable mutations in the HR pathway, which can substantially increase the risk of developing cancers other than CRC. Our analysis provides evidence for ATM and PALB2 as CRC-risk genes, underscoring the importance of the homologous recombination pathway in CRC. In addition, we identified frequent complete homologous recombination deficiency in CRC tumors, representing a unique opportunity to explore targeted therapeutic interventions such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).

       Findings: Identifies Homologous Recombination (HR) gene mutations (including ATM) as a major risk factor in CRC with heterogeneous phenotypes.
       Abstract: While genetic factors were associated with over 30% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, mutations in CRC-susceptibility genes were identified in only 5% to 10% of these patients. Besides, previous studies on hereditary CRC were largely designed to analyze germline mutations in patients with single genetic high-risk factor, which limited understanding of the association between genotype and phenotypes. From January 2015 to December 2018, we retrospectively enrolled 2,181 patients from 8,270 consecutive CRC cases, covering 5 categories of genetic high-risk factors. Leukocyte genomic DNA was analyzed for germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes. The germline mutations under each category were detected and analyzed in association with CRC susceptibility, clinical phenotypes, and prognoses. A total of 462 pathogenic variants were detected in 19.3% of enrolled CRC patients. Mismatch repair gene mutation was identified in 9.1% of patients, most prevalent across all high-risk groups. Homologous recombination (HR) gene mutations were detected in 6.5% of cases, penetrated in early-onset and extra-colonic cancer risk groups. Mutations in HR genes, including

       Abstract: Early T stage colorectal cancers (CRC) that invade lymph nodes (Stage IIIA) are rare and greatly under-represented in large-scale genomic mapping projects. We retrieved 10 Stage IIIA CRC cases, matched these to 16 Stage 1 CRC cases (T1 depth without lymph node metastasis) and carried out deep sequencing of 409 genes using the IonTorrent system. Tumour mutational burdens (TMB) ranged from 2.4 to 77.2/Mb sequenced. No stage-related mutational differences were observed, consistent with reanalysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Stage I and IIIA datasets. We next examined mutational burdens and observed that the top five cancers were microsatellite stable (MSS) genotypes (mean TMB 49.3/Mb), while the other 16 MSS cancers had a mean TMB of 5.9/Mb. To facilitate comparison with TCGA hypermutator CRC, we included four microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) samples with the high mutation burden MSS cases to form a TMB-High group. Comparison of TMB-High with TMB-Low groups revealed differences in mutational frequency of

       Findings: 15% of young CRC patients had P/LP variants including ATM; evaluated tumor MMR status; 80% of variants actionable.
       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in young adults is rising. Identifying genetic risk factors is fundamental for the clinical management of patients and their families. This study aimed to identify clinically significant germline variants among young adults with CRC. Whole-exome sequencing data of blood-derived DNA from 133 unrelated young CRC patients (<55 years of age) underwent a comprehensive analysis of 133 cancer-predisposition/implicated genes. All patient tumors were evaluated for mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). Among 133 patients (aged 16-54 years), 15% (20/133) had clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in at least 1 well established cancer-predisposing gene: dMMR genes (6), MUTYH [bi-allelic (2), mono-allelic (3)], RNF43 (1), BMPR1A (1), BRCA2 (4), ATM (1), RAD51C (1), and BRIP1 (1). Five patients (4%) had variants in genes implicated in cancer but where the significance of germline variants in CRC risk is uncertain: GATA2 (1), ERCC2 (mono-allelic) (1), ERCC4 (mono-allelic) (1), CFTR (2). Fourteen (11%) had dMMR tumors. Eighteen (14%) reported a first-degree relative with CRC, but only three of these carried P/LP variants. Three patients with variants in polyposis-associated genes showed no polyposis (one each in MUTYH [bi-allelic], RNF43, and BMPR1A). Approximately one in five young adults in our series carried at least one P/LP variant in a cancer-predisposing/implicated gene; 80% of these variants are currently considered clinically actionable in a familial cancer setting. Family history and phenotype have limitations for genetic risk prediction; therefore multigene panel testing and genetic counseling are warranted for all young adults with CRC regardless of those two factors.

       Findings: Germline ATM variants identified in CRC; germline carriers had better disease-free survival; germline status molds somatic landscape.
       Abstract: Although somatic mutations are the main cause of cancer, underlying germline alterations may affect cancer outcome. There is little information on comprehensive analysis of germline genome sequencing for cancer healthcare strategy. Here we studied the implication of germline cancer-associated variants on cancer counselling and therapeutic strategies by germline whole genome and tumor targeted sequencing. Fifty-five gynecological and 104 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were enrolled. We identified 22 germline pathogenic variants in 16 cancer-associated genes. Most of them are involved in DNA repair signaling, including MLH1, BRCA1/2, MUTYH, ATM, PMS2, MSH6, BAP1, and FANCA. About 6% of cancer patients presented the secondary findings of germline variants with non-oncogenic impact, mainly on the cardiovascular system which should be carefully monitored during chemotherapy. CRC patients carrying germline susceptibility variants had better disease-free survival than those without variants. Importantly, in the CRC model, the underlying germline alterations mold the tumor somatic alteration landscape. NOTCH1 mutation was the most common somatic mutation in recurrent CRC, implying a potential therapeutic target in adjuvant setting. In conclusion, both tumor genome and germline sequence data have to be analyzed to have a more complete picture of the overall genetic foundation of cancer.

       Findings: Identified germline ATM mutations in families with co-occurrence of pancreatic and colorectal cancer.
       Abstract: Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) is a rare hereditary tumor entity with broad phenotypic heterogeneity, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in some families. The underlying factors for this co-occurrence are still not well evaluated. FPC families in the National Case Collection of Familial Pancreatic Cancer with an additional occurrence of CRC were analyzed regarding the phenotype, genotype and recommendation for a clinical screening program. The total cohort of 272 FPC families included 30 (11%) families with at least one CRC case. The proportion of affected family members with PDAC was 16.1% (73/451) compared to 9.3% of family members with CRC (42/451, p < 0.01). Females were affected with PDAC in 49% (36/73) and CRC in 38% (16/42). The median age of PDAC was 63 compared to 66 years in CRC, whereas 8 (26.6%) of families had an early onset of PDAC and 2 (6.7%) of CRC. Seventeen families had 2 or more affected generations with PDAC and 6 families with CRC. Eleven (9.6%) of affected patients had both PDAC and CRC. Potentially causative germline mutations (2 ATM, 1 CDKN2a, 1 MLH1, 1 PALB2) were detected in 5 of 18 (27.7%) analyzed cases. These findings provide a step forward to include the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of FPC-CRC families for the genetic counseling and management of these families. Nevertheless, results need to be verified in a larger patient cohort beforehand.

       Abstract: Our ability to identify germline variants in hereditary cancer cases remains challenged by the incomplete cataloging of relevant genes and lack of consensus on who should be tested. We designed a panel [hereditary oncogenesis predisposition evaluation (HOPE)] that encompasses most of the genes known to be associated with cancer development and tested its yield on more than 1300 samples of cancer patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in high and intermediate risk genes were identified in 16, 23.9, 9.7 and 2.7%, respectively, of peripheral blood or normal tissue samples taken from patients with breast, ovarian, colorectal and thyroid cancer. To confirm specificity of these findings, we tested an ethnically matched cohort of 816 individuals and only identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 1.59% (0.98% in high risk and 0.61% in intermediate risk). Remarkably, pathogenic or likely pathogenic alleles in DNA repair/genomic instability genes (other than BRCA2, ATM and PALB2) accounted for at least 16.8, 11.1, 50 and 45.5% of mutation-positive breast, ovarian, thyroid and colorectal cancer patients, respectively. Family history was noticeably lacking in a substantial fraction of mutation-positive cases (63.7, 81.5, 42.4 and 87.5% in breast, ovarian, colorectal and thyroid, respectively). Our results show high contribution of germline mutations to cancer predisposition that extends beyond "classical" hereditary cancer genes. Family history was lacking in 63.5% mutation-positive cases, shows that hereditary cancer need not appear familial and suggests that relaxed selection of cancer patients for hereditary cancer panels should be considered.

       Findings: Israeli study found heterozygous ATM mutation carriers did not have a significantly increased risk of CRC compared to the general population.
       Abstract: Cancer risks in heterozygous mutation carriers of the ATM, BLM, and FANCC genes are controversial. To shed light on this issue, cancer rates were evaluated by cross referencing asymptomatic Israeli heterozygous mutation carriers in the ATM, BLM, and FANCC genes with cancer diagnoses registered at the Israeli National Cancer Registry (INCR). Comparison of observed to expected Standardized Incidence Rates (SIR) was performed. Overall, 474 individuals participated in the study: 378 females; 25 Arab and 31 Jewish ATM carriers, 152 BLM carriers, and 170 FANCC carriers (all Ashkenazim). Age range at genotyping was 19-53 years (mean + SD 30.6 + 5 years). In addition, 96 males were included; 5, 34, and 57 ATM, BLM, and FANCC mutation carriers, respectively. Over 5-16 years from genotyping (4721 person/years), 15 new cancers were diagnosed in mutation carriers: 5 breast, 4 cervical, 3 melanomas, and one each bone sarcoma, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer. No single cancer diagnosis was more prevalent then expected in all groups combined or per gene analyzed. Specifically breast cancer SIR was 0.02-0.77. We conclude that Israeli ATM, BLM, and FANCC heterozygous mutation carriers are not at an increased risk for developing cancer.

       Abstract: Alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway genes can be exploited by cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens that induce DNA damage. Platinum chemotherapy has been shown to be particularly effective in DDR-mutated populations. However, the clinical impact of DDR mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer is still unknown.

       Findings: Notes that germline ATM mutations are found in early-onset CRC patients and discusses risks of second primary cancers like AML.
       Abstract: Early onset colorectal cancer in persons younger than 50 years is increasingly common. Clinical and molecular characterizations reveal a distinctive disease. Thirty percent of patients have mutations of hereditary cancer syndromes, especially Lynch syndrome. A recent analysis, testing germline DNA for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes, showed that some patients younger than 50 years had mutations of high-penetrance colorectal cancer genes such as APC (adenopolyposis coli). Others had mutations in high-penetrance or moderate-penetrance genes not traditionally associated with colorectal cancer, such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), whereas still others had low penetrance colorectal cancer genes. In the current study, we examined the incidence of second cancers following early onset (age less than 50 y) colorectal cancer.

       Findings: Identified ATM germline variants in high-risk cancer patients; 26.4% of high-risk CRC patients had actionable variants.
       Abstract: Inherited pathogenic variants account for 5% to 10% of all breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. Here, we sought to profile the pathogenic variants in 25 cancer susceptibility genes in Turkish population. Germline pathogenic variants were screened in 732 BC patients, 189 CRC patients and 490 cancer-free elderly controls, using next-generation sequencing-based multigene panel testing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification testing. Pathogenic variants were detected in 17.2% of high-risk BC patients and 26.4% of high-risk CRC patients. More than 95% of these variants were clinically actionable. BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6) accounted for two-thirds of all pathogenic variants detected in high-risk BC and CRC patients, respectively. Pathogenic variants in PALB2, CHEK2, ATM and TP53 were also prevalent in high-risk BC patients (4.5%). BRCA1 exons 17-18 deletion and CHEK2 c.592+3A>T were the most common variants predisposing to BC, and they are likely to be founder variants. Three frequent MUTYH pathogenic variants (c.884C>T, c.1437_1439delGGA and c.1187G>A) were responsible for all MUTYH biallelic cases (4.4% of high-risk CRC patients). The total pathogenic variant frequency was very low in controls (2.4%) and in low-risk BC (3.9%) and CRC (6.1%) patients. Our study depicts the pathogenic variant spectrum and prevalence in Turkish BC and CRC patients, guiding clinicians and health authorities for genetic testing applications and variant classification in Turkish population.

       Abstract: Despite increasing use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), data concerning the gain in germline pathogenic variants (PVs) remain scanty, especially with respect to uncanonical ones. We aimed to verify the impact of different cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) on colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients referred for genetic evaluation.

       Abstract: The majority of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which are microsatellite stable (MSS) and do not harbor mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, are resistant to immunotherapy. Identification of patients with exceptional responses in MSS CRC and predictive biomarkers is an unmet need that needs to be addressed.

       Findings: Case report of an ATM-deficient CRC patient successfully treated with an off-label combination of Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) and irinotecan.
       Abstract: Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are constantly increasing in their indications for use as anti-cancer treatment in various neoplasms, the majority of which are linked with BRCA deficiency. Preclinical data support the investigation of PARP inhibitors in other neoplasms exhibiting "BRCAness" or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy. With the current report we present the case of a heavily pretreated 55-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IV ATM-deficient CRC, who was effectively treated with an off-label olaparib-irinotecan combination after exhaustion of all available treatment choices; furthermore, we discuss the existing data providing evidence for the use of PARP inhibitors in ATM-deficient CRC and encourage the implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in patients with no other available treatment options.

       Findings: Identified tumoral loss of ATM protein expression in 3.9% of colorectal cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry.
       Abstract: Mutations in the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene are frequently found in human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of ATM function confers sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) and topoisomerase inhibitors and may thus define a subset of cancer patients that could get increased benefit from these therapies. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic consequences of ATM missense changes reported in seven NSCLC cell lines with regard to radiosensitivity and functionality of ATM signalling. Our data demonstrate that only 2/7 NSCLC cell lines (H1395 and H23) harbouring ATM missense mutations show a functional impairment of ATM signalling following IR-exposure. In these two cell lines, the missense mutations caused a significant reduction in ATM protein levels, impairment of ATM signalling and marked radiosensitivity. Of note, only cell lines with homozygous mutations in the ATM gene showed significant impairment of ATM function. Based on these observations, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based assay to identify patients with loss or reduction of ATM protein expression in a clinical setting. In a set of 137 NSCLC and 154 colorectal cancer specimens we identified tumoral loss of ATM protein expression in 9.5% and 3.9% of cases, respectively, demonstrating the potential utility of this method.
