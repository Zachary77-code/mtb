       Abstract: Adagrasib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of mutant KRAS G12C protein, has shown clinical activity in pretreated patients with several tumor types, including colorectal cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that combining a KRAS G12C inhibitor with an epidermal growth factor receptor antibody could be an effective clinical strategy.

       Abstract: The current third-line (and beyond) treatment options for RAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer have yielded limited efficacy. At the time of study start, the combination of sotorasib, a KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)-G12C inhibitor, and panitumumab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, was hypothesized to overcome treatment-induced resistance. This phase 1b substudy of the CodeBreaK 101 master protocol evaluated sotorasib plus panitumumab in patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS

       Findings: Phase 1b trial of divarasib plus cetuximab showed a 62.5% ORR in KRAS G12C inhibitor-naive CRC patients and a median PFS of 8.1 months.
       Abstract: KRAS G12C mutation is prevalent in ~4% of colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Divarasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, has shown modest activity as a single agent in KRAS G12C-positive CRC at 400 mg. Epidermal growth factor receptor has been recognized as a major upstream activator of RAS-MAPK signaling, a proposed key mechanism of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition in CRC. Here, we report on divarasib plus cetuximab (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) in patients with KRAS G12C-positive CRC (n = 29) from arm C of an ongoing phase 1b trial. The primary objective was to evaluate safety. Secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity. The safety profile of this combination was consistent with those of single-agent divarasib and cetuximab. Treatment-related adverse events led to divarasib dose reductions in four patients (13.8%); there were no treatment withdrawals. The objective response rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval: 40.6%, 81.2%) in KRAS G12C inhibitor-naive patients (n = 24). The median duration of response was 6.9 months. The median progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 12.3). As an exploratory objective, we observed a decline in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency associated with response and identified acquired genomic alterations at disease progression that may be associated with resistance. The manageable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity of divarasib plus cetuximab support the further investigation of this combination in KRAS G12C-positive CRC.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04449874.

       Findings: Phase II trial of Garsorasib +/- cetuximab; combination therapy showed ORR of 45.2% and median PFS of 7.5 months in pretreated KRAS G12C CRC.
       Abstract: Mutations in the KRAS gene have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). KRAS G12C inhibitors overcome the "undruggable" challenge, enabling precision therapy. Garsorasib (D-1553), a highly potent and selective KRAS G12C inhibitor, has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profile in early clinical trials. We conducted an open-label, nonrandomized phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04585035) to assess the safety and efficacy of garsorasib with or without cetuximab in KRAS G12C-mutated CRC. In the monotherapy cohort (n = 26), objective response rate (ORR) was 19.2% (95% CI, 6.6-39.4), disease control rate (DCR) was 92.3% (95% CI, 74.9-99.1), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.9-11.6) and median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI, 9.5-NE). In the combination cohort (n = 42), ORR was 45.2% (95% CI, 29.8-61.3), DCR was 92.9% (95% CI, 80.5-98.5), median PFS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.5-8.1), and median OS was not reached. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 (19.2%) and 6 (14.3%) patients in monotherapy and combination cohort, respectively. Garsorasib with or without cetuximab showed a promising efficacy and manageable safety profiles in heavily pretreated patients with KRAS G12C-mutated CRC, providing a potential new treatment approach for such population.

       Findings: Reports efficacy data from Phase I-III trials showing combination therapy (EGFR + KRAS G12C inhibitors) is superior to monotherapy.
       Abstract: KRAS is a commonly mutated gene in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, inhibitors of KRAS G12C were developed and have shown promising efficacy for KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer. However, KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy has not demonstrated excellent efficacy for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC due to multiple resistance mechanisms, especially receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling activation. To overcome this resistance mechanism, various combinations of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS G12C inhibitors, including panitumumab plus sotorasib, have been investigated in clinical trials. The combination of EGFR and KRAS G12C inhibitors for KRAS G12C mutated CRC demonstrated overall response rates ranging from 26% to 62.5% in seven clinical trials of phase I to III, whose data are available so far. The median progression-free survival in these trials ranged from 3.9 to 8.1 months. These efficacy data suggest that KRAS G12C inhibitor combination with EGFR inhibitors is more effective for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC than KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy. They also showed reasonable safety of the combination regimen. Based on these results, phase III clinical trials are being conducted to investigate EGFR and KRAS G12C inhibitor combinations as a first or second-line treatment for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC. Furthermore, other KRAS G12C inhibitors, KRAS G12D inhibitors, and pan-RAS inhibitors are being developed, which could make more patients with advanced CRC eligible for KRAS inhibition.

       Findings: Systematic review of 9 clinical trials; combination of G12C inhibitors with EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab/panitumumab) significantly improves ORR and PFS.
       Abstract: Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who have KRAS mutations often see poor results with standard treatments, leaving them with fewer viable options. Over the past few years, new KRAS G12C inhibitors have emerged as a targeted approach for a specific subset of these mutations, though their effectiveness and safety in advanced CRC remain areas of ongoing research. In this systematic review, we identified nine clinical trials including a total of 668 patients, by searching PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and Embase through October 2024. When sotorasib was used alone, the objective response rate (ORR) ranged from 7.1 to 9.7%, with disease control (DC) rates of 73.8 to 82.3% and a median progression-free survival (PFS) spanning 4-5.6 months. Combining sotorasib with panitumumab, especially at higher doses, raised its ORR to 26.4%. Meanwhile, pairing adagrasib with cetuximab led to a 42% ORR and a median PFS of 6.9 months, surpassing the 19% ORR observed with adagrasib alone. Divarasib monotherapy produced a 36% ORR and an 85.5% DC rate, with a PFS of 5.6 months; in tandem with cetuximab, those numbers climbed to a 62.5% ORR and a PFS of 8.1 months. Common side effects across these trials included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and various skin reactions. Overall, KRAS G12C inhibitors appear to offer meaningful benefits for CRC patients, particularly when used alongside EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab or panitumumab. However, further large-scale, randomized trials are needed to refine dosing strategies and gain a clearer picture of both efficacy and potential risks.

       Findings: Narrative review of CodeBreak 300 trial data showing Sotorasib + Panitumumab improves PFS in refractory KRAS G12C mCRC.
       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a substantial global health challenge, ranking as the third most commonly diagnosed and second most fatal cancer worldwide. With an increasing incidence, particularly in older populations, CRC demands innovative therapeutic approaches to address the limitations of existing treatments. One critical target in CRC is the KRAS gene, which is frequently mutated and implicated in various cancer-related processes. This narrative review explores the promising role of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab combination therapy in CRC treatment. Combining Sotorasib with Panitumumab, an EGFR antagonist, offers a synergistic approach to comprehensively block KRAS and EGFR pathways, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms observed in monotherapies. The review discusses the evolution of CRC treatment from traditional chemotherapy to the advent of targeted therapies like Bevacizumab and Cetuximab. It highlights the limitations of existing therapies, including resistance and toxicities, emphasising the urgency for innovative approaches. The CodeBreak clinical trials, specifically CodeBreak 101 and CodeBreak 300, provide a focal point for evaluating the efficacy of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab in patients with refractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. Preliminary results demonstrate significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates, suggesting a paradigm shift in CRC treatment. The preliminary findings from the CodeBreak 300 trial signify a transformative impact of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab in refractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. With a notable increase in PFS and objective response rates and a well-tolerated safety profile, this combination therapy emerges as a potential new standard of care. The results present an optimistic outlook for patients resistant to conventional therapies.
