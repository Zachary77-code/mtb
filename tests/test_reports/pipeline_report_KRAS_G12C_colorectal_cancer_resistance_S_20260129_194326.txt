       Abstract: The current third-line (and beyond) treatment options for RAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer have yielded limited efficacy. At the time of study start, the combination of sotorasib, a KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)-G12C inhibitor, and panitumumab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, was hypothesized to overcome treatment-induced resistance. This phase 1b substudy of the CodeBreaK 101 master protocol evaluated sotorasib plus panitumumab in patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS

       Abstract: KRAS G12C mutation is prevalent in ~4% of colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Divarasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, has shown modest activity as a single agent in KRAS G12C-positive CRC at 400 mg. Epidermal growth factor receptor has been recognized as a major upstream activator of RAS-MAPK signaling, a proposed key mechanism of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition in CRC. Here, we report on divarasib plus cetuximab (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) in patients with KRAS G12C-positive CRC (n = 29) from arm C of an ongoing phase 1b trial. The primary objective was to evaluate safety. Secondary objectives included preliminary antitumor activity. The safety profile of this combination was consistent with those of single-agent divarasib and cetuximab. Treatment-related adverse events led to divarasib dose reductions in four patients (13.8%); there were no treatment withdrawals. The objective response rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval: 40.6%, 81.2%) in KRAS G12C inhibitor-naive patients (n = 24). The median duration of response was 6.9 months. The median progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95% confidence interval: 5.5, 12.3). As an exploratory objective, we observed a decline in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency associated with response and identified acquired genomic alterations at disease progression that may be associated with resistance. The manageable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity of divarasib plus cetuximab support the further investigation of this combination in KRAS G12C-positive CRC.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04449874.

       Findings: Detailed review of KRAS G12C + EGFR inhibitor combinations; notes ORRs of 26-62.5% and discusses overcoming RTK-mediated resistance.
       Abstract: KRAS is a commonly mutated gene in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, inhibitors of KRAS G12C were developed and have shown promising efficacy for KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer. However, KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy has not demonstrated excellent efficacy for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC due to multiple resistance mechanisms, especially receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling activation. To overcome this resistance mechanism, various combinations of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS G12C inhibitors, including panitumumab plus sotorasib, have been investigated in clinical trials. The combination of EGFR and KRAS G12C inhibitors for KRAS G12C mutated CRC demonstrated overall response rates ranging from 26% to 62.5% in seven clinical trials of phase I to III, whose data are available so far. The median progression-free survival in these trials ranged from 3.9 to 8.1 months. These efficacy data suggest that KRAS G12C inhibitor combination with EGFR inhibitors is more effective for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC than KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapy. They also showed reasonable safety of the combination regimen. Based on these results, phase III clinical trials are being conducted to investigate EGFR and KRAS G12C inhibitor combinations as a first or second-line treatment for KRAS G12C mutated advanced CRC. Furthermore, other KRAS G12C inhibitors, KRAS G12D inhibitors, and pan-RAS inhibitors are being developed, which could make more patients with advanced CRC eligible for KRAS inhibition.

       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a substantial global health challenge, ranking as the third most commonly diagnosed and second most fatal cancer worldwide. With an increasing incidence, particularly in older populations, CRC demands innovative therapeutic approaches to address the limitations of existing treatments. One critical target in CRC is the KRAS gene, which is frequently mutated and implicated in various cancer-related processes. This narrative review explores the promising role of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab combination therapy in CRC treatment. Combining Sotorasib with Panitumumab, an EGFR antagonist, offers a synergistic approach to comprehensively block KRAS and EGFR pathways, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms observed in monotherapies. The review discusses the evolution of CRC treatment from traditional chemotherapy to the advent of targeted therapies like Bevacizumab and Cetuximab. It highlights the limitations of existing therapies, including resistance and toxicities, emphasising the urgency for innovative approaches. The CodeBreak clinical trials, specifically CodeBreak 101 and CodeBreak 300, provide a focal point for evaluating the efficacy of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab in patients with refractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. Preliminary results demonstrate significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates, suggesting a paradigm shift in CRC treatment. The preliminary findings from the CodeBreak 300 trial signify a transformative impact of Sotorasib plus Panitumumab in refractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC. With a notable increase in PFS and objective response rates and a well-tolerated safety profile, this combination therapy emerges as a potential new standard of care. The results present an optimistic outlook for patients resistant to conventional therapies.

       Findings: Review of combination therapies (SHP2, SOS1, EGFR) to overcome KRAS G12C resistance, specifically highlighting CRC efficacy.
       Abstract: Although KRAS G12C inhibitors have proven that KRAS is a "druggable" target of cancer, KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapies have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy due to primary and acquired resistance mechanisms. Multiple combinations of KRAS G12C inhibitors with other targeted therapies, such as RTK, SHP2, and MEK inhibitors, have been investigated in clinical trials to overcome the resistance. They have demonstrated promising efficacy especially by combining KRAS G12C and EGFR inhibitors for KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer. Many clinical trials of combinations of KRAS G12C inhibitors with other targeted therapies, such as SOS1, ERK, CDK4/6, and wild-type RAS, are ongoing. Furthermore, preclinical data have suggested additional promising KRAS G12C combinations with YAP/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors, FAK inhibitors, and farnesyltransferase inhibitors. The combinations of KRAS G12C inhibitors with immunotherapies and chemotherapies have also been investigated, and the preliminary results were reported. More recently, KRAS-targeted therapies not limited to KRAS G12C are being developed, potentially broadening the treatment landscape of KRAS-mutated cancers. Rationally combining KRAS inhibitors with other therapeutics is likely to play a significant role in future treatment for KRAS-mutated solid tumors.

       Findings: Review focusing on EGFR reactivation as a primary resistance mechanism in CRC and the shift to dual EGFR/KRAS blockade.
       Abstract: KRAS mutations contribute substantially to the overall colorectal cancer burden and have long been a focus of drug development efforts. After a lengthy preclinical road, KRAS inhibition via the G12C allele has finally become a therapeutic reality. Unlike in NSCLC, early studies of KRAS inhibitors in CRC struggled to demonstrate single agent activity. Investigation into these tissue-specific treatment differences has led to a deeper understanding of the complexities of MAPK signaling and the diverse adaptive feedback responses to KRAS inhibition. EGFR reactivation has emerged as a principal resistance mechanism to KRAS inhibitor monotherapy. Thus, the field has pivoted to dual EGFR/KRAS blockade with promising efficacy. Despite significant strides in the treatment of KRAS G12C mutated CRC, new challenges are on the horizon. Alternative RTK reactivation and countless acquired molecular resistance mechanisms have shifted the treatment goalpost. This review focuses on the historical and contemporary clinical strategies of targeting KRAS G12C alterations in CRC and highlights future directions to overcome treatment challenges.

       Abstract: With the advent of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue G12C (KRAS G12C) inhibitors, RAS is no longer considered undruggable. For the suppression of RAS, new therapeutic approaches have been suggested. However, current clinical studies have indicated therapeutic resistance after short-lived tumour suppression. According to preclinical studies, this might be associated with acquired genetic alterations, reactivation of downstream pathways, and stimulation for upstream signalling. In this review, we aimed to summarize current approaches for combination therapy to alleviate resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors in colorectal cancer with a focus on the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. We also analysed the relationship between various mechanisms and therapeutic resistance.

       Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer in the world. Early screening and detection of tumours, active surgical radical treatment, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are performed based on pathological staging and immunohistochemistry. Even with these measures, the 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer is only 65%, and a considerable number of patients still experience tumour recurrence or even metastasis. The KRAS G12C mutation accounts for 3 to 4% of refractory colorectal cancer (advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer), and it was once believed that KRAS did not have a drug target until the emergence of KRAS G12C inhibitors provided targeted treatment for KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer. However, KRAS G12C inhibitors only produce moderate efficacy, and resistance occurs after a short remission. The mechanism of drug resistance in tumour cells is complex and diverse, and existing research has limited understanding of it. This review aims to elucidate the clinical trial progress of KRAS G12C inhibitors in refractory colorectal cancer, the research progress of drug resistance mechanisms, and the combined treatment strategies for drug resistance.

       Findings: Comprehensive review of KRAS G12C inhibitors in CRC, focusing on intrinsic/acquired resistance and rational combination strategies.
       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with approximately 40% of the patients carrying KRAS mutations. Among these, the KRAS G12C mutation accounts for approximately 4% of the cases. This mutation introduces a unique cysteine residue at codon 12, enabling covalent binding and rendering KRAS G12C a tractable therapeutic target. Recently, selective small-molecule inhibitors of KRAS G12C, including sotorasib and adagrasib, have shown encouraging activity in early clinical trials, indicating potential clinical benefits for this subset of patients. However, their translation into routine clinical practice has been challenged by intrinsic and acquired resistance, treatment-related toxicities, and the absence of reliable predictive biomarkers. The aim of this study is to construct a clear knowledge framework that could inform the design of future clinical trials and optimize clinical practice. Future studies should focus on developing more potent next-generation inhibitors, exploring and optimizing rational combination strategies with other targeted agents or immunotherapies, investigating innovative therapeutic methods, and systematically identifying and validating predictive biomarkers. Collectively, with these efforts, we aim to enhance the efficacy, overcome resistance, and advance precision therapy for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant CRC.

       Findings: Summarizes clinical evidence and biological breakthroughs for KRAS G12C inhibitors; addresses resistance and toxicity challenges.
       Abstract: KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. Its activating mutations are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to certain therapies, including anti-EGFR treatments in colorectal cancer. In particular, the KRAS G12C mutation, which accounts for approximately 3-4% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 12-14% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), involves a cysteine substitution at codon 12. This has provided the opportunity to develop selective covalent inhibitors that trap the mutant protein in its inactive state. The first targeted therapies for KRAS G12C-mutant cancers comprise sotorasib and adagrasib, both of which have been authorized for use in patients with previously treated NSCLC and CRC. Nevertheless, despite the evidence of clinical activity for this class of agents, primary and acquired resistance, dose optimization, and toxicity management remain significant open challenges. In this review, we summarize recent advances in KRASG12C tumor biology and pharmacological targeting. We also provide additional insights to guide future efforts to overcome the limitations of the current approaches and implement the treatment of KRASG12C-mutant cancers.

       Findings: Large-scale NGS study of 17,993 Chinese pan-cancer patients identified KRAS G12C mutation frequency at 1.81% overall, occurring most frequently in colorectal, pancreas, and lung cancers.
       Abstract: RAS family genes (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) were frequently observed in several tumors. The expression of constitutively active RAS proteins mediated by RAS variations promote the development of tumors. KRAS is an important prognostic and drug resistance biomarker. It would also be a promising drug target. Several trials which evaluating the efficacy of RAS G12C inhibitor in solid tumors are initiated. Herein, we analyzed the alterations status of KRAS/NRAS/HRAS across diverse solid tumors. The sing nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number variants (CNV) data of 17993 Chinese patients from 22 types of cancer were obtained in our database. Genomic profiling of DNA was performed through a next-generation sequencing on tissue. Only the pathogenic mutations and likely pathogenic mutations in clinical significance were rolled into our analysis. Among 17993 pan-cancer patients, the total RAS variants frequency was 22.58%. KRAS was the most frequently altered, followed by NRAS and HRAS. For the SNV, KRAS were most commonly found in pancreas cancer, intestine cancer and colorectal cancer. Further analysis among KRAS SNV patients showed that the mutation frequency of KRAS G12C, G12D, G12R, and G12V was 1.81%, 6.81%, 0.69% and 4.25%, respectively. A total of 21 in 22 types of solid tumors had KRAS G12C/D/R/V pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation, which occurred most frequently in colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer and lung cancer. Our results suggested that a variety of solid tumors may harbor KRAS G12C/D/R/V mutation. These patients may benefit from KRAS inhibitors.

       Abstract: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) somatic mutations occur in 30% to 40% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). These were thought to equally affect prognosis and resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents; however, recent data show the activity of KRAS-G12C and pan-RAS inhibitors. The effects of uncommon KRAS (uKRAS) variants are largely unexplored. The distribution and pathogenicity of uKRAS mutations and their relationship with patients' clinicopathologic features were assessed. A total of 2427 CRCs were profiled for KRAS using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The study and control groups included patients with uKRAS (<1% frequency in CRC data sets on cBioPortal) and canonical KRAS mutations, respectively. In silico protein structure modifications and prediction analyses were performed by using PyMOL, trRosetta, and PolyPhen-2. uKRAS mutations affected 35 cases (1.5%), with G13C (28.6%), G12R (20%), and V14I (8.6%) being most common. Missense mutations (D33E, G12W, G12F, Q22H, Q61L, and L19F) occurred in nine cases (25.7%). Duplications (G10dup and L52_G60dup) affected two cases. Pathogenicity analyses showed that G12W, Q22R, L56V, and A130I mutations are probably damaging, with scores between 0.928 and 1.000. No differences were seen in clinicopathologic features. uKRAS mutants had lower event-free survival but no difference in overall survival compared with controls. Although these data are hypothesis generating and need further confirmation, they highlight the importance of NGS-based profiling to identify CRC patients with uKRAS mutations as candidates for personalized therapy.

       Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third in global cancer prevalence, with 40% presenting as metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). KRAS mutations in mCRC patients confer resistance to anti-EGFR treatments. Promising inhibitors such as sotorasib and adagrasib targeting KRASG12C mutations have demonstrated efficacy. Herein, we present a heavily pretreated mCRC case with a progression-free survival of 12 months with sotorasib and panitumumab. In 2017, a 27-year-old male presented with abdominal pain and received a diagnosis of stage IIIC KRAS G12C mutant CRC. Following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, he developed metastases in the liver and lungs in 2020. Treatment with FOLFIRINOX and bevacizumab, and later FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, with surgeries and local interventions resulted in partial responses. Upon disease progression, sotorasib and panitumumab were initiated, achieving a complete metabolic response. After 12 months of progression-free survival, oligoprogressive liver lesions were surgically resected. This case highlights the remarkable outcome of a heavily treated KRAS G12C mutant mCRC patient. The combination of sotorasib and panitumumab, along with multidisciplinary approaches including surgery and local interventions, played an important role in our patient's survival.
