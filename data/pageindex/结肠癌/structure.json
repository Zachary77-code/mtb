Key points include: hepatic resection as the preferred curative approach for resectable liver metastases with the requirement for feasible complete (R0) resection, adequate future liver function, and absence of unresectable extrahepatic disease; avoidance of noncurative debulking; management of patients with an intact primary tumor by resecting both primary and metastatic sites either synchronously or staged (liver-first or primary-first) based on complexity and patient factors; consideration of fiducial markers before neoadjuvant therapy for small lesions; options for repeat resection/ablation in selected patients; strategies to increase resectability when remnant liver volume is inadequate (portal vein embolization, staged liver resection, or Y-90 radioembolization); use of thermal ablation alone or with resection when all original disease sites can be treated with adequate margins; selective use of arterially directed therapies (notably Y-90) for chemotherapy-refractory, liver-dominant disease; and cautious, selective use of ablative external beam radiation therapy (often in clinical trial settings) to avoid compromising potentially resectable/ablatable cases. For lung metastases, it emphasizes complete resection with preserved function, prior curative resection of the primary tumor, allowance for resection even with resectable extrapulmonary metastases, consideration of repeat resection/ablation, use of thermal ablation for small completely ablatable lesions (including some unresectable but ablatable cases), synchronous or staged approaches for synchronous metastases, and similarly selective use of ablative EBRT. The section also describes evaluation for conversion therapy: reassessing initially unresectable patients for resection/ablation after about 2 months of preoperative chemotherapy and every 2 months thereafter, prioritizing cases with limited-site disease, requiring that all original disease sites become treatable, and recommending high-response chemotherapy regimens for potentially convertible disease.

leaving positive nodes implies **incomplete (R2) resection**.\n  - **Minimum of 12 lymph nodes** should be examined for accurate N staging.\n  - Resection must be complete to be considered curative.\n\n- **Minimally invasive colectomy considerations**\n  - Laparoscopic/robotic approaches are acceptable when performed by experienced surgeons with appropriate preoperative localization and ability to perform thorough abdominal exploration.\n  - Generally not indicated for locally advanced tumors or acute obstruction/perforation, though may be considered with sufficient expertise.\n\n- **Hereditary syndrome surgical considerations**\n  - Directs clinicians to NCCN genetic/familial high-risk assessment guidelines for patients with suspected/known hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes.\n\n- **Image-guided tumor ablation (general principles)**\n  - Describes **thermal ablation** (radiofrequency, microwave, cryoablation) and **non-thermal ablation** (irreversible electroporation).\n  - Emphasizes need for ability to treat **all original disease sites** with adequate margins when using ablation alone or with surgery.\n\n- **Liver metastasis locoregional options**\n  - Thermal ablation for small liver metastases (alone, with surgery, for nonsurgical candidates, and for recurrence after hepatectomy/ablation if all visible disease can be treated with margins).\n  - Irreversible electroporation for lesions near critical structures (eg, central bile ducts) where safe margin ablation/resection is not feasible.\n\n- **Lung metastasis locoregional options**\n  - Thermal ablation may be used alone or with resection for resectable disease, for unresectable but ablatable disease, and for post-treatment recurrences if all visible disease is amenable.\n\n- **Arterially directed embolic therapies for liver-dominant disease**\n  - **Y-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE)**: considered as an alternative to portal vein embolization in select cases to increase future liver remnant and/or downsize tumors; also for chemotherapy-refractory, predominantly hepatic metastases; includes \u201cradiation segmentectomy\u201d for small tumors not eligible for resection/ablation.\n  - **Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)**: for highly selected chemotherapy-refractory cases with preserved liver function and liver-dominant disease; highlights **DEB-TACE with irinotecan (DEBIRI)** and potential combination with irinotecan-based systemic therapy.\n\n- **External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for metastases**\n  - EBRT can be considered for limited metastases (liver/lung/selected sites), symptomatic disease, or clinical trials.\n  - Techniques include 3D-CRT, IMRT, and **SBRT**; SBRT/hypofractionation with **BED10 >100 Gy** is preferred for oligometastatic durable local control, with attention to nearby organs.\n\n- **Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) therapy eligibility criteria**\n  - Requires multidisciplinary expertise and surgical candidacy.\n  - Indications include unresectable liver metastases or resectable liver metastases at high recurrence risk, after at least one line of systemic chemotherapy.\n  - Key exclusions/requirements: no extrahepatic disease (primary may remain), suitable arterial anatomy, no portal hypertension/active viral hepatitis, specified liver function thresholds, no concurrent bevacizumab/VEGF inhibitors, and no prior liver radiation.\n\n- **Criteria and principles for resectability of metastases (liver and lung)**\n  - **Liver**: hepatic resection is preferred for resectable CRC liver metastases; must be anatomically feasible with adequate future liver function; no unresectable extrahepatic disease; no debulking short of R0; synchronous primary and metastases can be resected in one or staged operations (liver-first or primary-first); options to increase resectability include portal vein embolization, staged resection, or Y-90; re-resection/re-ablation may be considered.\n  - **Lung**: requires complete resection with adequate function; primary tumor must have been resected with R0 intent; resectable extrapulmonary metastases do not automatically preclude lung resection; re-resection/re-ablation and ablation strategies are discussed; synchronous metastases may be treated synchronously or staged.\n\n- **Evaluation for conversion to resectable/ablatable disease**\n  - Reassess initially unresectable patients after ~2 months of chemotherapy and every 2 months thereafter.\n  - Conversion is more likely when disease is limited in sites; all original sites must become treatable.\n  - Recommends using preoperative chemotherapy regimens with high response rates for potentially convertible disease."

It outlines the typical diagnostic workflow: initial tumor testing using either **MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC)** or **microsatellite instability (MSI)** testing to identify dMMR/MSI-H tumors, followed by germline sequencing when indicated. It also describes the role of **BRAF mutation testing** and/or **MLH1 promoter methylation testing** when MLH1 loss is seen on IHC to distinguish sporadic MLH1 silencing from germline Lynch syndrome. The section emphasizes the widespread adoption and guideline support for **universal/reflex MMR or MSI testing** in all newly diagnosed colorectal (and often endometrial) cancers, and notes its relevance not only for Lynch identification but also for **treatment planning** (eg, stage II adjuvant decisions and stage IV therapy selection, including immunotherapy for dMMR/MSI-H disease).\n\n- **Role of vitamin D in colorectal cancer:**  \n  Summarizes observational evidence linking low vitamin D levels to higher CRC incidence and worse survival, including meta-analyses showing improved overall survival and disease-specific mortality with higher vitamin D levels. It then contrasts this with randomized trial evidence showing **no clear benefit** of vitamin D (and/or calcium) supplementation on adenoma recurrence overall, with possible genotype-dependent effects via vitamin D receptor variants. It notes that supplementation has not definitively improved CRC outcomes; even trials suggesting longer PFS with high-dose vitamin D did not show clear improvements in response rate or overall survival. Based on lack of level 1 evidence, the panel **does not recommend routine vitamin D screening or supplementation** specifically for CRC patients.\n\n- **Other risk factors and lifestyle influences on CRC risk and prognosis:**  \n  Reviews established and suspected CRC risk factors, including **inflammatory bowel disease**, smoking, red/processed meat intake, alcohol, diabetes, low physical activity, metabolic syndrome, and obesity/high BMI. It highlights cohort evidence that adherence to multiple healthy lifestyle factors substantially lowers CRC risk. It discusses mixed evidence on protective dietary factors (eg, dairy with limited/sex-specific associations; fish and legumes potentially lowering risk). It also addresses aspirin/NSAIDs as possible risk-reducing agents but notes variable evidence and that recent USPSTF updates find insufficient evidence that aspirin reduces CRC incidence. Finally, it notes associations between certain exposures (smoking, metabolic syndrome, obesity, red/processed meat) and **worse prognosis**, while post-diagnosis fish consumption may be linked to **better outcomes**, and reiterates that **family history increases risk**."

Higher suspicion is advised in patients >50 years, with family history of inflammatory bowel disease/colon cancer, or unexplained anemia. If appendicitis is treated nonoperatively, **repeat interval imaging** is emphasized; persistent findings may indicate malignancy.\n\n- **Diagnostic challenges and initial evaluation:** Appendiceal tumors can resemble colon cancer, gynecologic cancers, or other abdominal conditions.

Notes that imaging may be unreliable after appendiceal rupture with extra-appendiceal tumor dissemination; if clinical suspicion persists despite negative imaging, **diagnostic laparoscopy** should be considered.\n\n- **Metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma overview**: Emphasizes histologic heterogeneity and variable metastatic risk. Reports distant metastasis rates for colonic-type appendiceal adenocarcinoma and highlights the **peritoneum** as the most common metastatic site (liver/lung less common). Defines **AJCC M1 subcategories**: M1a (acellular intraperitoneal mucin), M1b (intraperitoneal mucinous epithelium), M1c (non-peritoneal metastasis). If disease extends beyond the peritoneum, treatment should follow **metastatic colon cancer** guidelines.\n\n- **Pathophysiology and terminology of mucinous peritoneal disease**: Describes how mucinous tumors can rupture and disseminate mucin/tumor cells throughout the peritoneal cavity. Explains that \u201cpseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)\u201d is an outdated umbrella term and summarizes WHO-aligned categories:\n  - **Low-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (MCP-L / former DPAM)**: mucin pools with low cellularity and noninfiltrative epithelium.\n  - **High-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (MCP-H / former PMCA)** and **MCP-H with signet ring cells (MCP-H-S / former PMCA-S)**: higher atypia/cellularity, mitotic activity, infiltrative behavior.\n\n- **Systemic therapy considerations**: States that chemotherapy regimens effective in colorectal cancer are used for appendiceal adenocarcinoma.

Recommends preoperative assessment using laparoscopy and **Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI)**; higher PCI predicts worse outcomes and less benefit. Explains **Completeness of Cytoreduction (CC) score** (CC-0/1 vs CC-2/3) and the importance of reducing residual tumor to \u22642.5 mm due to limits of intraperitoneal chemotherapy penetration. Notes typical use of perioperative systemic chemotherapy (often neoadjuvant up to ~6 months), potential conversion therapy for initially unresectable disease, long-term survival outcomes in successful cases, and lists clinical features discouraging CRS (eg, biliary obstruction, porta hepatis involvement, extensive retroperitoneal disease, major liver lesions, diffuse small bowel involvement/obstruction). Non-surgical candidates should be treated per metastatic colon cancer guidelines.\n\n- **Start of nonmetastatic disease section\u2014malignant polyp management**: Defines a **malignant polyp** as pT1 (submucosal invasion) and distinguishes **carcinoma in situ (pTis)** as not submucosal and not capable of nodal metastasis. Recommends **tattoo/marking the polypectomy site**, performing **MMR/MSI testing** during initial workup (Lynch syndrome assessment and treatment planning), and emphasizes pathology review and shared decision-making before surgery. States that no additional surgery is needed after complete endoscopic resection if **favorable histologic features** are present (grade 1\u20132, no angiolymphatic invasion, negative margin)."

Stents are mainly for distal lesions to decompress the proximal colon and allow later elective surgery. Evidence from meta-analyses and the ESCO randomized trial indicates **similar oncologic outcomes** for emergency surgery versus stenting as a bridge to surgery. Diversion followed by colectomy has similar short-term mortality/morbidity to immediate colectomy but may **reduce permanent colostomy rates**. Preoperative stoma education and site marking by an enterostomal therapist are recommended to improve outcomes.\n\n- **When to consider neoadjuvant therapy:** Patients with **bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b** may benefit from neoadjuvant treatment before resection. Recommended systemic options depend on tumor biology:\n  - **pMMR/MSS:** oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.\n  - **dMMR/MSI-H (especially cT4b):** chemotherapy or, preferentially, **checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy**.\n  If disease is **locally unresectable** or the patient is **medically inoperable**, systemic therapy, radiation, and/or chemoradiation is recommended, potentially to convert to resectability.\n\n- **Evidence for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOxTROT):** Neoadjuvant FOLFOX/CAPEOX is discussed as an option for bulky nodal disease or cT4b. FOxTROT feasibility and mature phase III results show neoadjuvant chemotherapy leads to **tumor and nodal downstaging**, higher rates of **histopathologically complete resection**, and a **lower 2-year residual/recurrent disease rate** compared with postoperative-only chemotherapy, supporting feasibility of this approach.\n\n- **Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in dMMR/MSI-H (NICHE/NICHE-2):** These studies demonstrate **very high pathologic response rates** with preoperative ipilimumab plus nivolumab in nonmetastatic dMMR colon cancer, including high major and complete pathologic response rates, low recurrence at reported follow-up, and relatively low rates of severe immune-related adverse events. The text notes limited benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in dMMR tumors in FOxTROT, supporting checkpoint inhibitors as preferred in that setting.\n\n- **Surgical management principles for resectable nonmetastatic disease:** Preferred operation is **colectomy with en bloc regional lymphadenectomy**, with extent determined by tumor location and vascular/lymphatic drainage. Apical and suspicious extra-field nodes should be sampled/removed when feasible. Curative intent requires **complete (R0) resection**; leaving positive nodes indicates incomplete (R2) resection.\n\n- **Quality of colectomy and complete mesocolic excision (CME):** The excerpt reviews data comparing **CME vs non-CME**, including the ESCME trial and observational studies. While local recurrence-free survival may be similar, some studies suggest **improved disease-free survival and/or reduced death/progression** with CME and improved specimen/lymph node yield; technique comparisons (eg, CME with central vascular ligation vs Japanese D3 high tie) show differences in mesentery and node harvest.\n\n- **Minimally invasive colectomy (laparoscopic vs open):** Laparoscopic colectomy is presented as an accepted option. Multiple randomized trials (Barcelona, COLOR, CLASICC, COST, and others) and meta-analyses generally show **similar long-term outcomes** (DFS, OS, recurrence) between laparoscopic-assisted and open colectomy, with some studies noting faster recovery/shorter hospital stay for laparoscopy, and some trial limitations affecting formal noninferiority conclusions."

It also notes higher treatment discontinuation and worse prognostic factors in older populations.\n\n- **Toxicity and early mortality risk with age:** Using large pooled trial data, it reports that the odds of 30-day mortality after adjuvant therapy increase nonlinearly with age, though absolute early mortality remains low. Overall, 5-FU/LV toxicity/benefit appears similar across ages, while oxaliplatin benefit in \u226570 remains unproven.\n\n- **Timing of adjuvant therapy after surgery:** Summarizes meta-analyses and registry studies indicating that delays in starting adjuvant chemotherapy (eg, each 4-week delay; delays beyond ~6\u20138 weeks) are associated with worse overall survival, while acknowledging potential confounding (comorbidities, emergency surgery, prolonged admissions). Mentions a perioperative 5-FU trial that showed no significant OS/DFS difference but was underpowered due to early termination.\n\n- **Management during leucovorin (LV) shortage:** Provides empiric strategies for LV shortages, including substituting **levoleucovorin** (dose equivalence noted, but higher cost) and using **lower LV doses** based on studies suggesting similar efficacy between low- and high-dose LV when combined with bolus 5-FU in adjuvant and metastatic settings."

          "summary": "This excerpt from the NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines (v1.2025) focuses on metastatic colorectal cancer with emphasis on liver (and to a lesser extent lung) metastases, covering:\n\n- **Epidemiology and prognosis of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM):** Liver metastases are common and often the cause of death in CRC; outcomes are poor without surgery. Poor prognostic factors include extrahepatic disease, >3 tumors, and short disease-free interval (<12 months). Differences between synchronous vs metachronous liver metastases are noted (synchronous associated with more extensive/bilobar involvement).\n\n- **Imaging for liver metastasis detection:** **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)** is discussed as a screening/characterization option for patients who cannot receive CT/MRI contrast or who have indeterminate lesions on CT/MRI, with advantages (high sensitivity for small lesions) and limitations (short contrast half-life requiring repeat injections; limited availability/expertise).\n\n- **Surgical management and outcomes:** Surgical resection of liver metastases is presented as the **standard of care** for resectable disease with potential for cure. Reported outcomes include ~20% 5-year disease-free survival after liver metastasectomy, median 5-year survival around 38% in meta-analysis, and very high 5-year overall survival for solitary metastasis (up to ~71%). The importance of careful selection and resectability assessment is emphasized.\n\n- **Pulmonary metastases and combined resections:** Principles for liver metastases generally apply to lung metastases; pulmonary metastasectomy outcomes are summarized (eg, 3-year RFS ~28%, OS ~78%). Combined liver and lung resections are possible in highly selected patients, with some supportive retrospective data.\n\n- **Extrahepatic metastases:** Evidence for resection of extrahepatic disease is limited; recurrence is common and survival is generally worse, but selected patients may benefit from **concurrent resection** of hepatic and limited extrahepatic disease (noting a subset remaining disease-free at ~26 months and supportive systematic review conclusions).\n\n- **Repeat surgery for recurrence:** Repeat hepatectomy for liver-only recurrence can be safe and beneficial in selected patients, though survival tends to decline with successive surgeries; extrahepatic disease at surgery predicts worse outcomes. Factors associated with better benefit include longer disease-free interval, solitary/small/unilobar recurrence, and absence of extrahepatic disease. Panel consensus supports considering re-resection of liver or lung metastases in carefully selected patients.\n\n- **Management of intact primary with synchronous metastases:** For resectable primary and resectable synchronous metastases, staged or simultaneous resections are options. For unresectable metastases with a non-obstructing intact primary, **palliative primary resection is rarely indicated**; systemic therapy is preferred initially.\n\n- **Local therapies beyond resection:**  \n  - **Thermal ablation** is described for nonsurgical patients and also for selected resectable patients with small lesions where adequate margins can be achieved; can be used alone or with surgery, aiming to treat all visible disease. High local control rates (>93%) are cited when margins are confirmed, and a \u201ctest-of-time\u201d strategy is discussed (ablation first with close follow-up, reserving resection for later if needed).  \n  - **SBRT** is presented as an option when lesions cannot be resected or ablated.  \n  - For patients with liver-only or liver-dominant disease not amenable to resection/ablation/SBRT, **arterially directed therapies** are mentioned.  \n  - **Yttrium-90 radioembolization in ablative doses (RADSEG)** is introduced as a potentially curative local approach for limited liver metastases not technically resectable/ablatable, with small retrospective cohorts showing high response and favorable control/survival."

Key points include:\n\n- **Repeat surgical resection for recurrent metastases:** Evidence supports that repeat hepatectomy (and re-resection of liver or lung metastases) can be safe and beneficial in carefully selected patients. Outcomes are better with longer disease-free intervals, solitary/small/unilobular recurrences, and absence of extrahepatic disease; prognosis worsens with extrahepatic disease and with each subsequent curative-intent surgery.\n\n- **Approach to synchronous primary tumor and metastases:** Patients with resectable primary colon cancer and resectable synchronous metastases may undergo staged or simultaneous resections. If metastases are unresectable and the primary tumor is intact but not causing acute obstruction, **palliative primary resection is rarely indicated**; **systemic therapy is preferred** initially.\n\n- **Local therapies for metastases (non-extirpative options):**\n  - **Thermal ablation (image-guided):** Historically for nonsurgical candidates, but also appropriate for small resectable metastases when adequate margins can be achieved. Can be used alone or with surgery if all visible disease is treated. The guideline highlights high local control rates when margins are confirmed and describes a \u201ctest of time\u201d strategy\u2014ablation first with close follow-up, reserving resection for later if needed.\n  - **SBRT:** Considered reasonable for patients whose disease cannot be resected or ablated.\n  - **Other arterially directed liver therapies:** For select patients with liver-only or liver-dominant disease not amenable to resection/ablation (and sometimes not suitable for SBRT), additional liver-directed options may be offered. The role and timing of these approaches remain controversial.\n\n- **Yttrium-90 radioembolization (including ablative-dose RADSEG):** Described as a potential local curative approach for limited liver metastases that are not technically resectable or ablatable, with small retrospective cohorts showing high response and favorable liver control/survival. A meta-analysis suggests similar efficacy among HAIC, Y-90 radioembolization, and TACE in unresectable colorectal liver metastases.\n\n- **Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy (HAIC):** Placement of a hepatic arterial port/pump with liver-directed chemotherapy is an NCCN option (category 2B), particularly around liver resection. Trials show improved hepatic disease-free outcomes versus systemic therapy alone, with mixed/limited overall survival benefit and higher toxicity in some studies. HAIC may help convert unresectable disease to resectable in some cases. Use is limited by biliary toxicity risk and need for specialized expertise; recommended only selectively at experienced centers.\n\n- **Arterially directed embolic therapy (TACE/DEB-TACE):** Describes TACE, especially **drug-eluting bead TACE with irinotecan (DEBIRI)**, including evidence from randomized and meta-analytic data suggesting safety and potential overall survival benefit versus systemic therapy in some studies, while noting the need for further trials."

Key points include:\n\n- **Bevacizumab with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for unresectable liver metastases (conversion intent):** Evidence shows improved response, survival, and higher R0 resection rates when bevacizumab is added to mFOLFOX6 versus mFOLFOX6 alone in unresectable RAS-mutant liver metastases; use is considered acceptable because resectability cannot be predicted upfront.\n\n- **Triplet chemotherapy (FOLFOXIRI) + bevacizumab vs doublets + bevacizumab in oligometastatic/unresectable settings:** Pooled and trial data (TRIBE/TRIBE2, CAIRO5, and other analyses) suggest FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab can improve outcomes (eg, PFS) and may increase R0 resection rates compared with doublet regimens + bevacizumab, including in certain right-sided tumor cohorts.\n\n- **Guidance on bevacizumab timing around surgery:** The panel **recommends against bevacizumab as neoadjuvant therapy for already resectable metastatic disease**. If bevacizumab was used for unresectable disease and the patient becomes resectable, recommended washout is **\u22656 weeks before surgery**, and restarting bevacizumab should be delayed **6\u20138 weeks after surgery**.\n\n- **Neoadjuvant anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab/panitumumab) for conversion to resectability in RAS/BRAF wild-type disease:** Trials (eg, CELIM and others) show that adding cetuximab to FOLFOX/FOLFIRI can increase resectability and R0 resection rates in liver-limited unresectable disease; meta-analyses show improved response rate, R0 resection rate, and PFS, but not consistent OS benefit.\n\n- **Mixed/negative findings in some anti-EGFR comparisons:** In a CAIRO5 cohort (left-sided, RAS/BRAF wild-type), bevacizumab vs panitumumab with doublet chemotherapy showed no significant difference and was closed early for futility.\n\n- **Panitumumab with intensified chemotherapy (FOLFOXIRI) vs FOLFOXIRI alone (VOLFI):** In potentially convertible unresectable metastases, FOLFOXIRI + panitumumab increased conversion to resectability and response rate, with similar PFS and a trend toward improved OS.\n\n- **TRIPLETE trial and NCCN recommendation against FOLFIRINOX/FOLFOXIRI + anti-EGFR intensification:** TRIPLETE found no added efficacy from mFOLFOXIRI + panitumumab compared with mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab, but higher GI toxicity; therefore, the panel **does not recommend** FOLFIRINOX/FOLFOXIRI combined with cetuximab or panitumumab for unresectable mCRC, while **FOLFOX or FOLFIRI + anti-EGFR** remain recommended options.\n\n- **Neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors for resectable dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1-mutated mCRC:** Despite limited direct trial data, the panel considers pembrolizumab, dostarlimab, or nivolumab (\u00b1 ipilimumab) as preferred neoadjuvant options in these biomarker-defined groups, with caution to monitor for progression that could jeopardize resectability.\n\n- **Perioperative chemotherapy for resectable metachronous liver/lung metastases:** Perioperative systemic therapy is recommended for most patients undergoing metastasectomy to eradicate micrometastatic disease; meta-analyses show improvements in **PFS/DFS**, but **no consistent overall survival benefit**."

          "summary": "This excerpt from the NCCN Colon Cancer Guidelines (v1.2025) focuses on management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with an emphasis on surgical resectability and the use of systemic therapy to convert unresectable disease to resectable disease. Key points include:\n\n- **Resectability as a curative endpoint:** Surgery should be pursued only when a complete (R0) resection of all known tumor is realistically achievable; incomplete resections (R1/R2) or debulking have not shown benefit. PET/CT\u2019s role in assessing resectability is referenced elsewhere in the guidelines.\n\n- **Neoadjuvant (\u201cconversion\u201d) therapy for initially unresectable, liver-limited disease:** In highly selected patients whose metastases are unresectable due to location/critical structure involvement, preoperative systemic therapy may be used to shrink tumors and enable later curative resection. Patients with extensive liver/lung metastatic burden are generally unlikely to become resectable and are not considered good candidates for conversion strategies.\n\n- **Choice of systemic therapy and goal:** Any active metastatic regimen may be used for conversion because the objective is maximal shrinkage of visible metastases rather than micrometastatic eradication.\n\n- **Chemotherapy-associated liver injury and timing of surgery:** Irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based regimens can cause steatohepatitis and sinusoidal injury, which are linked to higher morbidity after hepatectomy. Therefore, surgery is recommended as soon as the disease becomes resectable, and patients should undergo planned surgical re-evaluation about **2 months after starting therapy** and **every 2 months thereafter** if therapy continues.\n\n- **Evidence for conversion and secondary resection rates:** The text summarizes studies showing that regimens such as irinotecan + 5-FU/LV, FOLFOX, and oxaliplatin-containing therapies can lead to tumor reduction and allow a subset of patients to undergo secondary hepatic resection, with reported outcomes including progression/DFS and overall survival in selected responders.\n\n- **FOLFOXIRI vs FOLFIRI in unresectable disease:** Two randomized trials are cited showing higher R0 secondary resection rates with FOLFOXIRI compared with FOLFIRI, and follow-up data suggesting improved long-term survival with FOLFOXIRI.\n\n- **Targeted and immunotherapy additions based on biomarkers:** Chemotherapy may be combined with **bevacizumab** or with **cetuximab/panitumumab** for **KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type** unresectable synchronous disease. **Checkpoint inhibitors** are noted as options for **MSI-H/dMMR** or **POLE/POLD1 mutation\u2013positive** disease.\n\n- **Neoadjuvant bevacizumab considerations:** The excerpt reviews limited safety/efficacy data for preoperative bevacizumab, including concerns about wound-healing complications around major surgery, and mixed evidence regarding whether bevacizumab improves response/tumor regression in conversion settings\u2014appearing more supportive with irinotecan-based regimens and inconsistent with oxaliplatin-based regimens."

A randomized comparison of **FOLFIRI vs FOLFOX** sequences found **no significant difference** in PFS or OS. Meta-analyses support improved survival when patients receive all three key cytotoxics (**5-FU/LV, oxaliplatin, irinotecan**) at some point, with **no clear dependence on order**.\n\n- **Performance status considerations:** Reports pooled trial data indicating similar efficacy of intensive first-line therapy across performance status groups, but **higher GI toxicity risk** in patients with **performance status 2**.\n\n- **Emerging/ongoing comparisons:** Introduces the phase III **C-cubed** study comparing upfront combination therapy (fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin + bevacizumab) versus a sequential approach (details cut off in the excerpt)."

The guideline frames maintenance vs observation as a shared decision-making discussion given the likely lack of OS benefit.\n- **Biosimilars policy:** Defines biosimilars and states that FDA-approved biosimilars may be substituted for **bevacizumab** or **trastuzumab** wherever these agents are recommended in the colon cancer guidelines.\n- **Biomarker testing recommendations for mCRC:** Recommends testing for **KRAS/NRAS**, **BRAF**, **HER2 amplification**, and **MSI/MMR** status (if not already done). Testing can be single-gene or via **next-generation sequencing (NGS)**, with NGS preferred because it can detect rare actionable alterations (eg, **NTRK** and **RET fusions**) using tissue or liquid biopsy.\n- **Guidance on repeat molecular testing:** Generally discourages repeat testing after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy due to low likelihood of meaningful molecular change, but notes repeat testing may be considered to guide later targeted therapy, especially after targeted treatments where acquired resistance mutations are more common.\n- **RAS (KRAS/NRAS) mutations as negative predictors for anti-EGFR therapy:** Explains the EGFR\u2013MAPK pathway rationale and strongly recommends RAS genotyping for all mCRC patients. Tumors with KRAS/NRAS mutations (exons 2/3/4) should not receive **cetuximab** or **panitumumab**, as benefit is essentially absent and harm is possible; an exception is noted for **KRAS G12C** disease when anti-EGFR therapy is combined with **sotorasib** or **adagrasib** in later lines.\n- **Clinical trial evidence supporting extended RAS testing:** Summarizes findings from studies/trials (eg, PRIME, FIRE-3) showing worse outcomes or lack of benefit when anti-EGFR agents are used in RAS-mutant tumors, leading to regulatory labeling changes for panitumumab with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.\n- **KRAS G13D discussion:** Reviews mixed retrospective signals but concludes, based on prospective data and meta-analyses, that KRAS G13D tumors are not meaningfully more responsive to EGFR inhibitors than other KRAS-mutant tumors.\n- **When to test RAS:** Encourages early RAS testing in mCRC to plan the treatment continuum, but states RAS testing is **not recommended for stage I\u2013III** disease because anti-EGFR therapy has no role there.\n- **Specimen considerations:** Notes KRAS mutations occur early and are highly concordant between primary and metastatic sites; archived primary or metastatic tissue is acceptable, and new biopsies solely for RAS testing are discouraged if archived tissue exists.\n- **BRAF V600E mutations:** Describes prevalence (about 5%\u20139%), typical mutual exclusivity with RAS mutations, biologic rationale for EGFR resistance, and evidence showing **poor prognosis**. It summarizes mixed first-line data but stronger evidence in later lines and meta-analyses indicating little to no benefit (and possible harm) from cetuximab/panitumumab in BRAF V600E\u2013mutant tumors.\n- **Non-V600 BRAF mutations:** Introduces that the predictive impact of non-V600 BRAF alterations is less clear and references pooled data exploring these subtypes."

It also emphasizes that **BRAF mutations are strongly prognostic** (generally worse outcomes), with multiple trial and meta-analysis data linking BRAF mutation to poorer survival and high-risk clinicopathologic features (eg, proximal location, T4 stage, poor differentiation). The panel states **BRAF V600E predicts very low likelihood of benefit from cetuximab/panitumumab** unless used within a **BRAF-inhibitor regimen**, and recommends **BRAF genotyping at stage IV diagnosis**. For tumors that are **MSI-H/dMMR and BRAF V600E**, first-line **checkpoint inhibitor therapy is generally preferred**, with BRAF-targeted therapy later.\n\n- **HER2 amplification/overexpression:** Notes HER2 is uncommon overall in CRC but enriched in **RAS/BRAF\u2013wild-type** disease. The guidelines recommend **HER2 testing for all patients with metastatic CRC** and indicate HER2-targeted therapies as later-line options when HER2 is overexpressed/amplified.

Strongly recommends RAS genotyping for all mCRC patients and advises against using anti-EGFR antibodies in KRAS/NRAS-mutant tumors, with a noted exception for **KRAS G12C** disease when anti-EGFR therapy is combined with **sotorasib** or **adagrasib** in later-line settings."

Although some European studies (including with bevacizumab) reported manageable toxicity and similar efficacy to FOLFIRI/Bev, overall toxicity concerns\u2014potentially varying by patient ancestry\u2014lead the panel to **not recommend CapeIRI or CapeIRI/Bev as first-line mCRC therapy**.\n\n- **Regimens with negative phase III results:** The document lists several combinations that failed in phase III trials (eg, sunitinib+FOLFIRI; cetuximab+brivanib; erlotinib+bevacizumab; cediranib+FOLFOX/CAPEOX; atezolizumab+cobimetinib) and states these are **not recommended** for CRC treatment.\n\n- **Avoid combining multiple biologics:** Two phase III trials (PACCE, CAIRO2) showed that adding an anti-EGFR agent to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab **worsened PFS and increased toxicity**. The panel **strongly recommends against** concurrent use of **anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab/panitumumab) with anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab)**.\n\n- **First-line FOLFOX-based therapy guidance:** For initial therapy with **FOLFOX**, adding **bevacizumab** is an option; adding **panitumumab or cetuximab** is an option only for tumors with **wild-type KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF**.\n\n- **FOLFOX vs CAPEOX interchangeability:** For metastatic disease (with bevacizumab-containing regimens or chemotherapy alone), the panel considers **FOLFOX and CAPEOX interchangeable**, supported by large registry-based cohort data.\n\n- **Oxaliplatin neuropathy and treatment breaks:** Oxaliplatin is associated with **peripheral sensory neuropathy**.

The text highlights limited survival impact, potential management changes, and risks of false positives; PET/CT is not recommended for assessing chemotherapy response.\n\n- **Preoperative liver imaging considerations:** Suggests contrast-enhanced MRI as part of preoperative evaluation for potentially resectable liver metastases, particularly when CT and PET findings are discordant.\n\n- **Concept of conversion to resectability:** Defines potentially curable disease to include cases initially unresectable (often liver-only) that may become resectable after chemotherapy; emphasizes that extrahepatic disease usually precludes curative resection.\n\n- **Multidisciplinary coordination:** Recommends close communication among the care team and early evaluation by surgeons experienced in hepatobiliary or lung metastasectomy.\n\n- **Management options for resectable synchronous liver/lung metastases:** Describes simultaneous versus staged resections (including \u201cliver-first\u201d approaches) and emerging strategies incorporating systemic therapy before metastasectomy and/or primary tumor resection.\n\n- **Perioperative systemic therapy recommendations by tumor biology:**\n  - For **pMMR/MSS** disease: outlines options including (1) surgery (colectomy plus liver/lung resection) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (preferred FOLFOX or CAPEOX; also 5-FU/LV or capecitabine), (2) 2\u20133 months neoadjuvant chemotherapy (preferred FOLFOX/CAPEOX; FOLFIRI or FOLFIRINOX as category 2B) followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy, or (3) colectomy then chemotherapy then staged metastasectomy followed by adjuvant therapy. Notes limited evidence supporting FOLFIRI/FOLFIRINOX in this neoadjuvant setting (category 2B).\n  - For **dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1-mutated** disease: indicates neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is preferred; surgery remains preferred when feasible, with local therapies considered selectively. Total neoadjuvant plus adjuvant treatment duration should not exceed 6 months.\n\n- **Adjuvant chemotherapy evidence and controversy:** Cites the JCOG0603 trial in liver-only metastases showing improved disease-free survival with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 after hepatectomy but higher overall survival in the surgery-alone arm, underscoring ongoing debate about benefit.\n\n- **HAI chemotherapy option:** For liver-only metastases, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (with or without systemic 5-FU/LV) remains a category 2B option at experienced centers."

If converted, proceed with synchronous/staged resections and perioperative chemotherapy for a preferred total of 6 months; adjuvant options include active metastatic regimens (biologics category 2B), observation, or shortened chemotherapy if substantial pre-op therapy was already given. HAIC remains an option for liver-only disease; ablation may be used when all measurable metastases can be treated.\n  - If disease is not responding: proceed with systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic disease; debulking surgery or ablation without curative intent is not recommended.\n  - Review of evidence on resecting an asymptomatic primary tumor in the setting of unresectable metastases: retrospective/registry studies suggest possible survival benefit, but randomized data (JCOG1007) show no OS benefit and highlight operative mortality; CAIRO4 reports higher 60-day mortality with upfront primary resection; NSABP C-10 supports feasibility of systemic therapy (mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab) without upfront primary resection in asymptomatic patients."

Treatment is stratified by resectability, prior chemotherapy/immunotherapy exposure, and tumor biology (pMMR/MSS vs dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1). For resectable pMMR/MSS disease, recommends resection plus ~6 months perioperative chemotherapy (regimen selection based on prior therapy; FOLFOX or CAPEOX preferred if no prior chemotherapy). For resectable dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1-mutated disease, neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is an option if immunotherapy-na\u00efve.

It then discusses major randomized trials (FACS, COLOFOL, CEAwatch, and others including PRODIGE 13), emphasizing that more intensive strategies (frequent CT imaging and/or CEA monitoring) often increase earlier detection and rates of curative-intent secondary surgery, but generally do not demonstrate a clear overall survival or mortality benefit compared with less intensive or symptom-based follow-up."

It reviews the prognostic impact of body weight, noting that obesity (especially pre-diagnosis) is generally associated with higher recurrence and mortality risk, discusses conflicting observations in metastatic disease and the proposed \u201cobesity paradox,\u201d and ultimately recommends achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nThe text also highlights dietary patterns associated with improved recurrence and survival outcomes\u2014more fruits/vegetables, whole grains, poultry/fish; less red/processed meat, refined grains, and sweets\u2014and reports associations between high glycemic load and sugar-sweetened beverages with increased recurrence/mortality in stage III colon cancer. It frames survivorship as a \u201cteachable moment\u201d and notes that behavioral coaching (eg, telephone-based programs) can improve activity, diet, and BMI. Practical survivorship recommendations include at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days, a plant-forward diet, limiting/eliminating alcohol, and smoking cessation, with modifications as needed for treatment sequelae (eg, ostomy, neuropathy, bowel dysfunction).\n\nA section on secondary chemoprevention reviews limited evidence for improved survival with post-diagnosis statin use and stronger evidence that low-dose aspirin after CRC diagnosis reduces recurrence and death, with possible (but inconsistent) predictive value of PIK3CA mutations.
